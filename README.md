# TensorKartRealHW

This is the code used in the machine-learning controlled Mario Kart 64 video: https://youtu.be/DViXD0ebg_E

It's a fork of the awesome TensorKart by Kevin Hughes.


## Usage

The usage is similar to the original TensorKart, except for the joycontrol and joycontrol_cruise_control scripts:
They expect the path to the serial device of the Pico as first argument.

## License

Just like TensorKart, this code is licensed under the MIT license.
